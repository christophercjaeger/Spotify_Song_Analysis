This project explores what makes a song popular on Spotify by analyzing track-level features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, loudness, tempo, and release year. The goal is to understand how these attributes influence popularity and whether trends change over time.

I used SQL for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and aim to use R for statistical modeling, and Tableau for interactive visualization in the near future.
